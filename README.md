# Rebug
A Gorilla Tag mod that reactivates the Debug UI used by the developers of the game, useful for mod development. 

## NOTE:
Lofiat will not maintain this mod, So I will, thats why its a fork, Full permission was given to re-publish

## Usage:
Press the secondary button on your left controller to change debug mode. There are three modes, basic, logging, and inactive, all pretty self explainatory.
